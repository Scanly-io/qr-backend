## 💡 Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about a recent project"

**Situation:**  
"After my previous role ended in August 2025, I decided to build a comprehensive SaaS platform from scratch to strengthen my full-stack and system design skills while creating something with real market potential."

**Task:**  
"I identified an opportunity in the QR code and microsite builder market, currently dominated by platforms like QR Code Generator and Linktree. My goal was to build a more feature-rich platform with better analytics and customization options."

**Action:**  
"Over 5 months, I:
- Architected an 18-service microservices platform using event-driven patterns
- Designed and documented every component, from database schema to API endpoints
- Built 40+ reusable content blocks for the microsite builder
- Implemented real-time analytics tracking with device and location detection
- Created complete technical documentation including architecture diagrams, API specs, and project roadmap
- Set up observability infrastructure with Mixpanel and Sentry"

**Result:**  
"The platform is now 35% complete with all core infrastructure in place. I have a clear 4-month roadmap to MVP launch in June 2026. More importantly, this project demonstrates my ability to:
- Design complex distributed systems
- Work independently and manage large projects
- Make technical decisions across the full stack
- Create production-ready, scalable architecture
- Document thoroughly for future team members"

### "Why the gap in employment?"

**Response:**  
"After leaving my last role in August 2025, I made a strategic decision to invest time in building a significant project that would:
1. Deepen my expertise in modern full-stack development and system design
2. Create a portfolio piece that demonstrates end-to-end ownership
3. Potentially launch as a SaaS business

I've been treating this like a full-time role - I have detailed task breakdowns, weekly sprints, and clear milestones. The result is a comprehensive platform with 18 microservices, complete technical documentation, and a clear path to market. This period has been incredibly valuable for my growth as an engineer and product builder."

### "What technologies are you most excited about?"

**Response:**  
"I'm really excited about modern event-driven architectures. In my QR platform, I implemented Kafka for inter-service communication, which solved problems like:
- Decoupling services (analytics doesn't block QR generation)
- Reliable event processing (scan tracking never gets lost)
- Scalability (can add consumers without changing producers)

I also dove deep into modern frontend patterns - React Server Components, optimistic updates with React Query, and building a truly reusable component system. The microsite builder has 40+ blocks that can be composed infinitely, similar to Notion's block system."
