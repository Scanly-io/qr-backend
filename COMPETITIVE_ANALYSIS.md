## 🎯 MARKET GAPS IDENTIFIED

### Gap #1: Local Business Focus
**Problem:** All tools focus on creators/influencers or enterprises. Nobody serves:
- Coffee shops

- Gyms
- Small retail stores
- Local restaurants

**Opportunity:** Build specifically for local businesses with:
- Industry templates (menu QR, appointment QR, review QR)
- Offline-to-online focus
- Simple pricing ($9-19/mo)

---

### Gap #2: Combined QR + Bio Link (Done Right)
**Problem:**

- Nobody combines both seamlessly

**Opportunity:** One platform where:
- QR code = beautiful landing page automatically
- Edit QR destination anytime
- Both work together, not separate tools

---

### Gap #3: Extreme Simplicity
**Problem:**
- Bitly, Hovercode = too complex
- Beacons = too many features
- QR Code Generator = dated UI

**Opportunity:** 
- "30 seconds to first QR code"
- Industry templates (click "Restaurant" → done)
- Modern, mobile-first design

---

### Gap #4: Pricing Sweet Spot
**Problem:**
- Free tiers too limited (Bitly: 10 links)
- Premium tiers too expensive (Linktree: $24/mo, Bitly: $199/mo)
- Enterprise only (Flowcode: $500+/mo)

**Opportunity:** Pricing ladder:
- **Free:** 3 QR codes, 1 bio link page, basic analytics
- **Pro ($9/mo):** Unlimited QR, custom branding, better analytics
- **Business ($19/mo):** Custom domain, team features, API access
- **Enterprise ($49/mo):** White-label, priority support

---

### Gap #5: Industry-Specific Solutions
**Problem:** All competitors are generic

**Opportunity:** Templates for:
- **Restaurants:** Menu QR, review request, Instagram follow
- **Salons:** Appointment booking, service menu, loyalty program
- **Gyms:** Class schedule, sign-up form, social links
- **Retail:** Product info, return policy, feedback form
- **Events:** RSVP, schedule, speaker bios
